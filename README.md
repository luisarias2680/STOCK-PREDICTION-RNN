# STOCK-PREDICTION-RNN
This project focuses on stock price prediction, leveraging historical data sourced from a CSV file. The primary goal is to develop models capable of analyzing past trends and patterns to generate forecasts regarding future price movements within the stock market.

At its core, the project allows for the seamless loading and processing of historical stock data directly from CSV files, enabling easy integration with various data sources. It applies advanced time series analysis techniques to understand the dynamic behavior of stock prices over time. Leveraging machine learning (and/or deep learning) algorithms, robust predictive models are built to identify complex relationships within the data and project future movements.
